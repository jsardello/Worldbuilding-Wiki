# The Mortal Realms

The Mortal Realms are 7 "mirror realms" that contain the vast majority of life in the known universe. Each Realm share the following characteristics:
- No Void - The Mortal Realms are an infinite expanse of the vaccum of space. No Void exists except as a separating barrier between each Realm.
- Affixed Celestial Bodies - At the moment of creation, the celestial bodies of each realm were an exact copy of the others. Time, magical influences, and the butterfly effect have caused differentiation between the realms, but the general placement of stars, planets, and other major celestial bodies remain highly correlated.
- Magic - The Mortal Realms are suffused with magic. Stars generate magic which then twists and twines around matter. Any celestial body of significant size will attract the magic of nearby stars.
- Life - Created life, both with and without souls are prevalent throughout the Mortal Realms. Humanity is a constant across. In the modern era. Billions of years of magical and evolutionary selection have significantly differentiated the core created species.

## Infinite and Finite

Each realm is infinite. In the same way that our universe is described as an infinite vaccum of space in which matter is scattered throughout, the Mortal Realms are infinite. However, the distribution of matter, life, and magic is concentrated into a measurable 3-D space known as the Central Finite Curve.

## Mirror Realms

The planets and start of each realm occupy very similar locations. Because of this, there is a magical harmoic resonance between each. The closer the planets and stars align, the stronger this resonance becomes. At the apex of this resonance, it is possible to 'affix' celestial bodies of different realms to each other with a magical Nail.

Nails are a relatively recent advent of Mortals, although similar methodology was used to create the Stairway to Heaven. They primarily serve as a means of travel between realms. The magical resources it requires to hop between realms normally is so vast, that it unattainable for all the the apex of magic weilders. However, if a civilization is capable of the planning, engineering, and magic needed to form a Nail, they unlock vastly efficient means of regularly hopping between the same world on a different realm.

## Magic on Matter

Magic, the power of The Creator, flows out of stars and into realms like a river with billions of differnt sources. This tapestry of magical weaves bends and twists across space, seemingly attracted to large bodies of matter. Because of this virtually all planets within the universe are exposed to magical flows. These planets are effected over time by the magic that flows past them. The evolution of life is greatly impacted by magical warp and influences the differentiation of life across the start far more than simple evolutionary biology.

Although the exception to the rule, there are some areas of "null space" that magic inexplicably does not flow through. These areas tend to see much slower and more stagnant evolutionary patterns. Civilizations in these null spaces are pushed toward technological advancements at a much faster rate than those that have access to magical flows.
