In My Universe, the creator of all existence is a singular supreme being. Referred to as "The Creator" by his creations, he is also known as (capitol G) God to deliniate him from the pantheon of (little g) gods.

The Creator is said to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. But in the present day, his defining characteristic is his absence. Shortly after creating the universe and awakening the first of the Pantheon, The Creator ascended and the universe has not felt his touch since.

## The Creation Moment

In the beginning, there was <a href="/posts/wiki-2-the-void">the Void</a>. An infinite expanse of nothingness. More than nothingness, it is an anti-ness. The complete opposite of a created thing. The Void is not a place, it is a state of being. It is the absence of existence. From this raw material, the Creator divided The Void into 255 Realms, distinct planes of existence that are separated from one another by a buffer of Void. Even after this separation, most Realms are majority-filled with Void. The Creator focused most of his power of Making onto 14 different realms. 7 are The Mortal Realms, and the other 7 are The Divine Realms.

In that moment of creation, The Mortal Realms were filled with the infinite vaccumm of space. Trillions stars, planets and other celestial bodies were sent spinning out into space much like we concieve the Big Bang to have taken place in our own universe. From that genesis point, the River of Magic began. Magic started flowing among the stars twisting itself around matter and suffusing the universe with a chaotic flow of magical energy.

The Divine Realms are finite in comparison. The Creator sculpted out a measurable and fixed amount of Void and filled it completely with matter. There is no space vaccum in the Divine Realms. Matter presses right up to the barrier of Void. The measurement of the width of the Divine Realms is known as the "Central Finite Curve". Interestingly, this measurement seems to have a reflective property on The Mortal Realms. The vast majority of stars, planets, and life reside within the Central Finite Curve.
